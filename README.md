# Welcome to My Cybersecurity Portfolio

## Nmap and Wireshark Vulnerabilities and Network Scan Analysis

### Project Description
This project, conducted as part of my studies at Western Governors University, aimed to identify and analyze network vulnerabilities and anomalies using Nmap and Wireshark in a virtual lab environment. The objective was to uncover potential security risks within the network by conducting a comprehensive scan and traffic analysis. The findings from this analysis were used to inform recommendations to enhance the network's security posture, protecting it against emerging threats.

The project demonstrates the practical application of network mapping and monitoring tools in maintaining cybersecurity, with a focus on real-world scenarios and proactive defense strategies.

### Key Highlights

- **Tools Used**: Nmap, Wireshark
- **Focus Areas**: Vulnerability scanning, network topology analysis, traffic inspection, threat identification
- **Outcome**: Enhanced security recommendations for the network, protection against potential exploits
# Nmap and Vulnerability Analysis

This project involves analyzing a network topology using Nmap and identifying vulnerabilities associated with various systems. Below are the images and their corresponding descriptions that detail the analysis.

## Topology Overview
